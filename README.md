# ASSIGNMENT TITLE
This was a brief exercise completed for Coding Dojo.
### Objectives:
* Get comfortable with loops: `for` and `while`
* Get comfortable with conditionals: `if/else`
* Using a loop write code that will `console.log` all of the odd values from 1 up to 20
* Using a loop write code that will `console.log` all of the values that are evenly divisible by 3 from 100 down to 0
* Using a loop write code that will `console.log` the values in this sequence `4, 2.5, 1, -0.5, -2, -3.5`
* Write code that will add all of the values from 1-100 onto some variable `sum` and at the end `console.log` the result `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100`. We should get back `5050` at the end
* Write code that will multiply all of the values from 1-12 onto some variable `product` and at the end `console.log` the result `1 * 2 * 3 * ... * 10 * 11 * 12`. We should get back `479001600` at the end

### Additional functionality for extra practice:
* I wrote them all in Python as well, just for reinforcement in Python.

## Takeaways:
Despite this being a fairly simple exercise, I learned something. I realized that the exercise which iterates down numbers by `1.5` was very easy to write in JS as a `for` loop, but I realized quickly that it is easier in Python to write this as a `while` loop, because iterating down in `float` values in python is harder in a `for` loop without libraries. This made me think that maybe next time I can use `while` in JS -- especially when it would be more concise than an otherwise perfectly fine `for` loop.
